# Material Stock Manager

This Streamlit app allows you to track materials in stock. Materials are chosen
from a small predefined list:

* Piedra Caliza
* Durmientes de Madera
* Malla de Acero

You can:

1. Add a material from the list with an initial quantity.
2. Increase or decrease the quantity of an existing material.
3. View a table and bar chart showing the current stock levels.

Run the app with `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.
